# Object-Oriented Programming

## Pillars

### Abstraction

Abstraction is to turn real world objects, properties, and behaviors into a computational representation.

### Encapsulation

Encapsulation is to protect internal properties and behaviors of an object from being manipulated externally.

### Inheritance

Inheritance is to reuse properties and behaviors of a base class by a derived class.

### Polymorphism

Polymorphism is the ability of an object to assume and be used as other forms.
